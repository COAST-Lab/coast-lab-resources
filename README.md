# COAST Lab Resources
Helpful information for COAST Lab members

The goal of this repository is to provide all COAST Lab members (students, staff, faculty, prospective members, etc.) information that they might need to better understand some element of their roles. An abundance of information exists on UNCW webpages and handbooks, and we try not to provide information identical to that provided elsewhere to avoid confusion. Links to external references are too frequently changed to keep up to date here. 

What information do you think should be covered here? Please add an issue or fork this repo, add the needed content, and submit a pull request to have it added!
